                        <h2>Sites Constructor</h2>
                        <p>The Internet is something is part of our lives. It has transformed the way we live and is here to stay. The trend is that it occupies an increasing space in our daily routines. The advent of the covid-19 pandemic accelerated the process of to use this tool in many aspects of our lives, such as communication, studies, medicine, food, etc. As I mentioned before, company that is not present in this new world has a high chance of disappearing, because out of sight, out of mind, and, consequently, will be forgotten. So, your company needs to occupy a place in this vast universe. No matter the size of your business. No matter if you only work with people in your neighborhood, YOUR BUSINESS NEEDS TO BE ON THE INTERNET! Think with me, when you need a service, no matter what it is, from a mechanic to a pet shop, from a beauty salon to a restaurant, and you don't know which one to hire, what do you do? If among your answers is: 'I search on Google', you do what millions of people in the world do, that's fantastic. But why is this powerful tool good for others and not good for your company? Maybe because you don't understand anything about technology, and that is rocket science? Maybe, you think you are not capable learn and engage in this new world? Whatever the reason, this is no justification for your business walking toward the abyss. Once again, I ask you to think with me, do you need to know everything about mechanics to buy a car? Do you need to know about material expansion, to know about fluid dynamics to buy a house? Do you need to be an expert in finance, accounting to have a company? I agree that it is good to have at least a sense of what we are involved with, but we, usually hire qualified people to meet our needs, such as a mechanic, an engineer, an architect, a realtor, an accountant, etc., the same with services on the Internet. Another detail we need to consider is that having a commercial point in this universe is not rocket science, but similarly to the real world, you need to do a few things to let people know you're there. If your physical establishment does not have a visual communication (a facade, a sign, a totem, a sign, or a sign), how will people know that your establishment exists and what type of products or services it offers? </p>
